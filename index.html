      <h3>Welcome to My Art Page</h3>
      <h4>This is a compilation of most of my drawings, sketches, paintings and stylings that I have done through the years. There are a lot missing, and a lot that I have forgotten about, so if you are one of my friends or family that has an artwork that I have done, please contact me so I can add it to this collection.</h4>

      <p>I have never been the most organized person, and like I've said, this is just but a few of the arts that I have made.</p>
      <p>This is mostly for my mom who is and has always been a fan of my doodles since I coud hold a pencil between my fingers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is for my brother and my sister.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is for all my friends, near and far.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is also for the people that encouraged me greatly, and more importantly, believed in me, so much so that I started believing in myself.</p>
      <br>
      <p>These drawings are good.</p>
